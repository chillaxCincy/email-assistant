Product Vision — Email Assistant for Rotation Policies

Vision

Provide a quiet, always-on assistant that reads incoming Outlook messages about the neurology rotation, finds the right policy text, and prepares accurate, courteous draft replies with citations—so the human can stay focused and simply approve and send.

Target Users
	•	Primary: Clerkship Director/Coordinator (single user for MVP)
	•	Secondary: Students and faculty (benefit indirectly from faster, consistent answers)

Value Proposition
	•	Faster responses without sacrificing accuracy
	•	Consistent tone and structure
	•	Traceable decisions via policy citations
	•	Self-hosted for privacy and cost control

Principles
	1.	Safety first: never auto-send; clear citations
	2.	Grounded answers: “only from docs” with visible sources
	3.	Simple ops: local-first, minimal moving parts
	4.	Human-in-the-loop: drafts to approve, not autonomous agents

Success (12–16 weeks outlook)
	•	70–80% of routine emails can be addressed from drafts with minimal edits
	•	Single daily review session replaces ad-hoc interruptions
	•	Clear audit trail of answers and sources

Non-Goals (MVP)
	•	Attachment automation
	•	Exposed webhooks or public endpoints
